This is an incremental project! 


Starting with Rails and Vue, I'll be adding VueX, Redis, and whatever else strikes my fancy.

GOAL:
A site where users can go to upload images of upset animals!
    
A user will be able to add images, at first via URL, then via upload.
    -Users can comment on these images.
    -Users can like and favorite images.
    
Users will be able to create accounts and log in.
    -Creating an account will automatically log in as that user. 
    -Users can also log out.

Users will have a profile.
    -Favorited images appear on their profile. 
    -Analytics can appear here too
